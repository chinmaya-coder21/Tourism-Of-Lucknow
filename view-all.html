<h3 class="monument-style2">Dewa Sharif</h3>
</div>

<div class="monument-style3">

<p class="monument-style4">About 25 km from Lucknow in the Barabanki district, Dewa Sharif is a famous pilgrimage town. The main attraction of this historically rich town is the tomb of Sufi Saint Haji Waris Ali Shah, an exponent of universal brotherhood, who is believed to have commanded mystical powers. 

Devotees from all across the world visit this place throughout the year to pay their respects to the 'mazars' (graves), famously called Dewa Sharif. A popular fair known as Dewa Mela is held here on the occasion of the annual Urs, generally during the months of October and November. The highlights of the fair include Kavi Sammelans (gathering of poets), musical performances, etc. The fair ends with a brilliant display of fireworks.

Dewa Sharif is also one of the few places in the country where people come together to play Holi, irrespective of their faith. This is because Haji Waris Ali Shah believed that every religion is based on love and devotion, and started this tradition of brotherhood. He is now revered by Hindus and Muslims alike, who come to the shrine to seek his blessings.

<div class="Dudhwa-National-Park">

<p class="monument-style4">Dudhwa Tiger Reserve is one of the most protected sanctuaries in India, comprising two distinct zones – Bhabar, characterised by hills and rocky terrain, and Terai, distinguished by thick grasslands and clay-rich swamps. The latter is home to a large population of mammals and birds, and is thus listed among globally important eco-regions. This large ecosystem stretches from River Yamuna in the west to Valmiki Tiger Reserve (Bihar) in the east. The park spreads across five states along the Shivalik range of hills, and the Gangetic plains.

At present, certain endangered species like the Bengal florican and Hispid hare are protected at Dudhwa. Other than the tiger, 13 species of mammals, nine species of birds, and 11 species of reptiles and amphibians that are considered endangered are also found here. Other animals you are likely to spot at Dudhwa include birds like the painted stork, black and white necked stork, crane, heron, drongo, owl, egret, duck, goose, hornbill, woodpecker, barbet, kingfisher, minivet, bee-eater etc.; and reptiles like python, monitor lizard and gharial.<p>

<div class="Hussainabad-Imambara">

<p class="monument-style4">Lucknow is full of stellar examples of Nawabi architecture, but there are few that compare to the Chhota Imambara, built by Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah in 1838. The Nawab’s mausoleum, as well as his mother’s, are present here.

The complex comprises of the tomb of Princess Zinat Algiya, the daughter of the king of Awadh, a watchtower known as Satkhanda, a ceremonial gateway called Naubat Khana, and the Husainabad mosque. The Chhota Imambara boasts a gilded dome, several turrets and beautiful chandeliers. It comprises five doorways and Islamic verses have been carved into its exterior walls. There are two main halls, namely Shenasheen and Azakhana. The latter is embellished with gilt-edged mirrors and colourful stuccos, as well as exquisite chandeliers that are said to have been brought from Belgium. It is because of these lamps and crystal chandeliers that this iconic building is also known as the palace of lights. <p>

<p class="monument-style4">Located on the banks of River Gomti, the sacred place of Naimisharanya is linked to Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, Goddess Sati and Lord Shiva. The word 'nemi' refers to the outer surface of the Sudarshana chakra (Lord Vishnu's weapon), and it is said that the place where it fell came to be known as Naimisharanya, the boundary of which includes the surrounding forest area. The spot where the chakra struck the earth, a water spring came out. Major attractions in Naimisharanya include Chakratirth, which marks the spot where Brahma’s chakra fell; Dashashwamedha Ghat, where Lord Rama performed the tenth Ashwamedha Yagna; Hanuman Garhi, where Lord Hanuman is said to have emerged after his victory over Ahiravana in Patal Lok; Lalita Devi Temple, dedicated to the presiding deity of Naimisharanya; Nardanand Saraswati Ashram, a centre for spiritual education; Pandal Kila, the fort of king Virat from the epic Mahabharata; Sita Kund, where Goddess Sita is said to have bathed before going into exile, and many other significant spots.
