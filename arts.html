	<h2>Chikankari</h2>
	<p class="food-subtitle">A delicate hand embroidery technique done on fabrics like chiffon, muslin, organza, organdie and silk, chikankari is one of the most important crafts in Lucknow. The word 'chikan' means embroidery, and this form of art incorporates 36 different stitching techniques. In the beginning, only white yarn or muslin cloth was used. Stitching is done on the back of the cloth whereas the design is made on the front by tiny, running stitches. There are three main types of stitches – flat, embossed, and jaali (net effect). Due to a Persian influence, flowers have a permanent place in this art form. Typical chikankari motifs include creepers and vines. However, the types and styles in which these flowers are made keep varying with fashion trends. Today, there are hundreds of retailers of chikankari fabric across the country. In Lucknow, the lanes of markets are dotted with shops selling chikan work in various forms. You can pick up shirts, kurtas, bedsheets, table cloth, pillow covers and many other items adorned in chikankari. 

The technique is supposed to have been introduced by Mughal empress, Nur Jahan, in the 17th century.  Another legend speaks of a thirsty traveller, who stopped at a village in Lucknow, and requested a villager for water. Humbled by the villager’s hospitality and generosity, he imparted the skill of chikankari to him as an act of gratitude.

	<h2 class="Zardozi">Zardozi</h2>
	<p class="food-subtitle">This signature embroidery art of Lucknow has been around for centuries and has been been accorded a Geographical Indication tag (GI). Lucknow is the primary centre for zardozi, and apparels featuring this embroidery can be found in well-known shops of Chowk area, as well as other bazaars in the city. In Persian, 'zardozi' means gold embroidery. 

The original process, which is known as “Kalabatun”, made use of silk threads wrapped in real gold or silver; the thread was subsequently sewn onto different fabrics, and then embellished with gold threads, spangles, seed pearls, wires, beads, sequins etc. In the times of the nawabs, zardozi was used to decorate tapestries and wall hangings. Even elephants and horses were covered with heavy cloths adorned with zardozi. In that era, this form of embroidery was considered a luxury, since it could only be done on heavier fabrics like velvet, satin and silk. Therefore, only the royalty could afford it. It was regarded as a symbol of opulence.
