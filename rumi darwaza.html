<p class="monument-style4">Identical in design to an ancient gate in Constantinople in Turkey, Rumi Darwaza was built in the 1780s by Nawaz Asaf-ud-Daula, an Awadhi nawab. Also referred to as Turkish Gate, the ornate structure is marked by an eight-faceted umbrella-like structure in its uppermost part. Now a symbol of Lucknow, Rumi Darwaza was earlier used as an entrance gate to the Old City, and soars to a height of 60 ft. It was built to generate employment during the famine of 1784. The architectural style of the gate is distinctly nawabi, differentiated from the Mughal style by the material used â€“ where the latter preferred red sandstone, the formed used bricks coated in lime, allowing for more detailed sculpting, which would be near impossible on stone. The darwaza boasts intricate carvings of flowers. In its prime, the gateway had a huge lantern at the top, which would be lit at night, with jets of water flowing from the arch. For first-time visitors to the city, Rumi Darwaza is a must-see. Almost all the guided tours and heritage walks feature this icon on their itineraries.The Rumi Darwaza (Gate) is an incredible structure which stands imposingly between Bara Imambara and Chota Imambara in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. Constructed in 1784 under the rule of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula, it is a fine example of Awadhi architecture, or the Lucknow School of Architecture. It was a style adopted by the Nawabs of Awadh to preserve the Mughal architectural style while experimenting with newer styles and materials.</p>
