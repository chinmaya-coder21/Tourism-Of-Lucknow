<p class="monument-style4">Surrounded by terraced lawns and gardens, the Residency, overlooking River Gomti, is one of the oldest buildings in the city. Originally, it was built as a large complex of residential quarters, armoury, stables, dispensaries, worship places, for the British General, a representative of the British East India Company, during the rule of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan between 1780 and 1800. Today, the ruins of the building reflect its former glory and allow one to soak in its colonial charm while visiting. The Baillie guard gate, named after Residency’s first resident, Col John Baillie, gives you a glimpse of the architecture and design you will see inside. The treasury, which was completely destroyed during the sepoy mutiny of 1857, and a marble plaque honouring the brave soldiers of that time, are the two structures you will see as you walk towards the main buildings. The banquet hall, still bearing intricate carvings and featuring high ceilings, with a pretty fountain in the centre, will transport you back to the time of grand ballroom dances and opulent parties. Opposite the hall stands Dr Fayrer’s (resident surgeon) house, used as a shelter for the British during the mutiny, as well as a makeshift hospital. 

The Residency Museum, within the campus, has collections of photographs, paintings and documents showcasing visual details of the 1857 sepoy mutiny. There is also a memorial for one of the major generals of the British and his wife, in addition to the Brigade Mess, and Begum Kothi, which was occupied by Begum Makhdarah Aliya, a foreigner married to a Nawab. Tourists can also visit the ruins of a church near the Residency.</p>
