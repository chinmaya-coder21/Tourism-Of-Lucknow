<p class="monument-style4">Translating to martyrs' memorial, Shaheed Smarak is a white marble structure standing amidst a beautiful park. It was built in 1970 by the Lucknow Development Authority on the banks of River Gomti opposite the Residency, in order to commemorate hundreds of soldiers who lost their lives during the 1857 freedom movement of India. The monument was designed and conceptualised by celebrated architect Prasanna Kothari, and emulates the style of Amar Jawan Jyoti, located at the India Gate in New Delhi, which also pays tribute to the thousands of jawaans who gave up their lives for the security of the nation. You can pay your respect to those who sacrificed their lives for the country, and spend some time exploring the vast grounds while stealing a moment of peace and serenity.Shaheed Smarak, one of the must visit monuments in Lucknow, is a tall monolithic structure which stands proudly against the lush gardens. Many people may not have heard of it, and lesser still may have visited it. Located on the banks of River Gomti, it possesses both historical and cultural importance. The Shaheed Smarak was built in the 1970's as a tribute to those soldiers who lost their lives in the freedom struggle, as well as to mark the First War of Independence in 1857 against the East India Company. It is a great place to spend a day out with your friends and family.</p>
